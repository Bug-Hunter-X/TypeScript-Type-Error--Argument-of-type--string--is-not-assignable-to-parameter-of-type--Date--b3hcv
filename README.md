This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript type error and its solution. The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, where a function expects a Date object as an argument but receives a string.  The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a corrected version of the function, addressing the type mismatch.  This example highlights the importance of type safety in TypeScript and how to handle potential type errors.
